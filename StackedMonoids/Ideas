-- Ideas:
-- Enhance the NLT structure to parameterize over if the lists can be empty 
-- This will correspond to identitites
-- Also lists can be replaced to binary trees if the structure is not associative
-- Commutativity seems in general to be hard,
-- whereas associativity+commutativity is a multiset
-- where 
-- ∙ 1 or more elements if no identities
-- ∙ 0 or more elmenets if identities
-- ∙ ℤ if inverses
-- ∙ abs max 1 if idempotent? (hmm)
--
-- However, it is not straightforward to represent bags/multisets.
--
-- Finally, what happens when we add distributivity and absorption?
-- These are the most interesting laws: they allow ring and lattice solvers.
